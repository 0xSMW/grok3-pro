what is an estimated dollar spend per day on us black projects

whats a good estimate on the people and materials that this is supporting.

check the latest numbers and provide an estimate with the latest data (JUNE 2025)

The latest public documents show the U.S. “black” budget trending upward.  Congress appropriated $106.3 billion for FY 2024 and the executive branch has requested $101.6 billion for FY 2025 and $81.9 billion for FY 2026 (NIP only, MIP still pending).  Using the last fully enacted figure, the hidden enterprise is burning ≈ $292 million every day.  Roughly half of that sum covers pay and benefits for about 260-270 thousand cleared professionals; the rest keeps satellites, stealth aircraft, hypersonic test articles, and secure digital backbones moving through the pipeline.
