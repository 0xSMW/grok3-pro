# Grok³ Pro

A tiny CLI that asks xAI's **Grok 3 Mini** several times in parallel, majority-votes the results, and prints the winner.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
# 1 – install deps
pnpm install

# 2 – your xAI key
export XAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"

# 3 – ask a one-off question
ts-node grok3-pro.ts "What is 101 * 3?"
```

### Using a prompt file

Put your question in a text file (this repo ships with an example `prompt.txt`):

```bash
# will stream the first sample and append the final answer to prompt.txt
ts-node grok3-pro.ts --file prompt.txt
```

---

## 🛠 Flags

Flag | Description | Default
---- | ----------- | -------
`[k]` | number of parallel samples | `5`
`--file, -f <path>` | read question from file and append the answer | —
`--system, -s <path>` | custom system prompt (falls back to `system.txt` if present) | —

---

## 🧐 What happens internally

1. Compose a prompt: `Q: … A:` and launch *k* requests with `temperature 0.9` and `reasoningEffort "high"`.
2. The first request streams so you see tokens immediately; the rest run non-streaming.
3. Tally identical `answer` strings and pick the majority.
4. Print the winning answer (plus Grok's hidden reasoning for the streamed call).

## 📦 Build once & run without ts-node

```bash
npx tsc grok3-pro.ts --outDir dist
node dist/grok3-pro.js "Your question"
```
